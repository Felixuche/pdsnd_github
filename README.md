Download Atom or another text editor that allows you to preview markdown files. If you are unfamiliar with Markdown, more details on this are provided in the Tasks: Documentation page.
See the next few pages for detailed instructions on the tasks you need to set up and edit your repository. Remember, as you complete these tasks, you should be copying and pasting the git commands you use into the submission template.
Refactor code:
